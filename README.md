# N-BodySimulation(WIP)
Made using raylib and c++
<br>
Features to add/edit
1) Better physics for simulation (Velocity Verlet or RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4))
2) Set more predefined solar systems etc? Edit the "orbital speed" function as well
3) Edit the radius and mass sliders to function better and use a better scale (log?) (radius units fix as well)
4) Allow editing of already placed planets
5) Clear and Pause buttons
