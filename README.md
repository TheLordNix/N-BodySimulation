# N-BodySimulation (WIP)
Made using raylib and c++
<br>
# Features to add/edit (in no particular order)
1) ** Better physics for simulation (Velocity Verlet or RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4))
2) Set more predefined solar systems etc? Edit the "orbital speed" function as well
3) Edit the radius and mass sliders to function better and use a better scale (log?) (radius units fix as well)
4) Allow editing of already placed planets
5) Clear and Pause buttons
6) Speed values displayed break at higher values (?)
7) ** ADD COLLISIONS
8) Show preview of new planet being dragged and dropped as well
